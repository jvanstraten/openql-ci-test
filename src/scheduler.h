/*
    Summary

    Below there really are two classes: the dependence graph definition and the scheduler definition.
    All schedulers require dependence graph creation as preprocessor, and don't modify it.
    For each kernel's circuit a private dependence graph is created.
    The schedulers modify the order of gates in the circuit, initialize the cycle field of each gate,
    and generate/return the bundles, a list of bundles in which gates starting in the same cycle are grouped.

    The dependence graph (represented by the graph field below) is created in the Init method,
    and the graph is constructed from and referring to the gates in the sequence of gates in the kernel's circuit.
    In this graph, the nodes refer to the gates in the circuit, and the edges represent the dependences between two gates.
    Init scans the gates of the circuit from start to end, inspects their parameters, and for each gate
    depending on the gate type and parameter value and previous gates operating on the same parameters,
    it creates a dependence of the current gate on that previous gate.
    Such a dependence has a type (RAW, WAW, etc.), cause (the qubit or classical register used as parameter), and a weight
    (the cycles the previous gate takes to complete its execution, after which the current gate can start execution).

    In dependence graph creation, each qubit/classical register (creg) use in each gate is seen as an "event".
    The following events are distinguished:
    - W for Write: such a use must sequentialize with any previous and later uses of the same qubit/creg.
        This is the default for qubits in a gate and for assignment/modifications in classical code.
    - R for Read: such uses can be arbitrarily reordered (as long as other dependences allow that).
        This event applies to all operands of CZ, the first operand of CNOT gates, and to all reads in classical code.
        It also applies in general to the control operand of Control Unitaries.
        It represents commutativity between the gates which such use: CU(a,b), CZ(a,c), CZ(d,a) and CNOT(a,e) all commute.
    - D: such uses can be arbitrarily reordered but are sequentialized with W and R events on the same qubit.
        This event applies to the second operand of CNOT gates: CNOT(a,d) and CNOT(b,d) commute.
    With this, we effectively get the following table of event transitions (from left-bottom to right-up),
    in which 'no' indicates no dependence from left event to top event and '/' indicates a dependence from left to top.
             W   R   D                  w   R   D
        W    /   /   /              W   WAW RAW DAW
        R    /   no  /              R   WAR RAR DAR
        D    /   /   no             D   WAD RAD DAD
    When the 'no' dependences are created (RAR and/or DAD),
    the respective commutatable gates are sequentialized according to the original circuit's order.
    With all 'no's replaced by '/', all event types become equivalent (i.e. as if they were Write).

    Schedulers come essentially in the following forms:
    - ASAP: a plain forward scheduler using dependences only, aiming at execution each gate as soon as possible
    - ASAP with resource constraints: similar but taking resource constraints of the gates of the platform into account
    - ALAP: as ASAP but then aiming at execution of each gate as late as possible
    - ALAP with resource constraints: similar but taking resource constraints of the gates of the platform into account
    - ALAP with UNIFORM bundle lengths: using dependences only, aim at ALAP but with equally length bundles
    ASAP/ALAP can be controlled by the "scheduler" option. Similarly for UNIFORM ("scheduler_uniform").
    With/out resource constraints are separate method calls.

    Commutation support during scheduling in general produces more efficient/shorter scheduled circuits.
    It is enabled by option "scheduler_commute".

            // In dependence graph construction, this leads to WAW-dependence chains of all uses of the same qubit,
            // and hence in a scheduler using this graph to a sequentialization of those uses in the original program order.
            //
            // For a scheduler, only the presence of a dependence counts, not its type (RAW/WAW/etc.).
            // A dependence graph also has other uses apart from the scheduler: e.g. to find chains of live qubits,
            // from their creation (Prep etc.) to their destruction (Measure, etc.) in allocation of virtual to real qubits.
            // For those uses it makes sense to make a difference with a gate doing a Read+Write, just a Write or just a Read:
            // a Prep creates a new 'value' (Write); wait, display, x, swap, cnot, all pass this value on (so Read+Write),
            // while a Measure 'destroys' the 'value' (Read+Write of the qubit, Write of the creg),
            // the destruction aspect of a Measure being implied by it being followed by a Prep (Write only) on the same qubit.
            // Furthermore Writes can model barriers on a qubit (see Wait, Display, etc.), because Writes sequentialize.
            // The dependence graph creation below models a graph suitable for all functions, including chains of live qubits.

            // Control-operands of Controlled Unitaries commute, independent of the Unitary,
            // i.e. these gates need not be kept in order.
            // But, of course, those qubit uses should be ordered after (/before) the last (/next) non-control use of the qubit.
            // In this way, those control-operand qubit uses would be like pure Reads in dependence graph construction.
            // A problem might be that the gates with the same control-operands might be scheduled in parallel then.
            // In a non-resource scheduler that will happen but it doesn't do harm because it is not a real machine.
            // In a resource-constrained scheduler the resource constraint that prohibits more than one use
            // of the same qubit being active at the same time, will prevent this parallelism.
            // So ignoring Read After Read (RAR) dependences enables the scheduler to take advantage
            // of the commutation property of Controlled Unitaries without disadvantages.
            //
            // In more detail:
            // 1. CU1(a,b) and CU2(a,c) commute (for any U1, U2, so also can be equal and/or be CNOT and/or be CZ)
            // 2. CNOT(a,b) and CNOT(c,b) commute (property of CNOT only).
            // 3. CZ(a,b) and CZ(b,a) are identical (property of CZ only).
            // 4. CNOT(a,b) commutes with CZ(a,c) (from 1.) and thus with CZ(c,a) (from 3.)
            // 5. CNOT(a,b) does not commute with CZ(c,b) (and thus not with CZ(b,c), from 3.)
            // To support this, next to R and W a D (for controlleD operand :-) is introduced for the target operand of CNOT.
            // The events (instead of just Read and Write) become then:
            // - Both operands of CZ are just Read.
            // - The control operand of CNOT is Read, the target operand is D.
            // - Of any other Control Unitary, the control operand is Read and the target operand is Write (not D!)
            // - Of any other gate the operands are Read+Write or just Write (as usual to represent flow).
            // With this, we effectively get the following table of event transitions (from left-bottom to right-up),

            // that there is no order among Ds nor among Rs, but D after R and R after D sequentialize.

// =========== plain schedulers, just ASAP and ALAP, without RC

/*
    Summary

    The schedulers are linear list schedulers, i.e.
    - they scan linearly through the code, forward or backward
    - and while doing, they maintain a list of gates, of gates that are available for being scheduled
      because they are not blocked by dependences on non-scheduled gates.
    Therefore, the schedulers are able to select the best one from multiple available gates.
    Not all gates that are available (not blocked by dependences on non-scheduled gates) can actually be scheduled.
    It must be made sure in addition that:
    - those scheduled gates that it depends on, actually have completed their execution
    - the resources are available for it
    Furthermore, making a selection from the nodes that remain determines the optimality of the scheduling result.
    The schedulers below are critical path schedulers, i.e. they prefer to schedule the most critical node first.
    The criticality of a node is measured by estimating
    the effect of delaying scheduling it on the depth of the resulting circuit.

    The schedulers don't actually scan the circuit themselves but rely on a dependence graph representation of the circuit.
    At the start, depending on the scheduling direction, only the top (or bottom) node is available.
    Then one by one, according to an optimality criterion, a node is selected from the list of available ones

    also having scheduled a node, some new nodes may become available because they don't depend on non-scheduled nodes anymore;
    those nodes are found and put in the available list of nodes.
    This continues, filling cycle by cycle from low to high (or from high to low when scheduling backward),
    until the available list gets empty (which happens after scheduling the last node, the bottom (or top when backward).

// =========== schedulers with RC
    // Most code from here on deals with scheduling with Resource Constraints.
    // Then the cycles as computed from the depgraph alone start to drift because of resource conflicts,
    // and then it is more optimal to at each point consider all available nodes for scheduling
    // to avoid largely suboptimal results (issue 179), i.e. apply list scheduling.

    // In critical-path scheduling, usually more-critical instructions are preferred;
    // an instruction is more-critical when its ASAP and ALAP values differ less.
    // When scheduling with resource constraints, the ideal ASAP/ALAP cycle values cannot
    // be attained because of resource conflicts being in the way, they will 'slip',
    // so actual cycle values cannot be compared anymore to ideal ASAP/ALAP values to compute criticality;
    // but when forward (backward) scheduling, a lower ALAP (higher ASAP) indicates more criticality
    // (i.e. in ASAP scheduling use the ALAP values to know the criticality, and vice-versa);
    // those ALAP/ASAP are then a measure for number of cycles still to fill with gates in the schedule,
    // and are coined 'remaining' cycles here.
    //
    // remaining[node] indicates number of cycles remaining in schedule after start execution of node;
    //
    // Please note that for forward (backward) scheduling we use an
    // adaptation of the ALAP (ASAP) cycle computation to compute the remaining values; with this
    // definition both in forward and backward scheduling, a higher remaining indicates more criticality.
    // This means that criticality has become independent of the direction of scheduling
    // which is easier in the core of the scheduler.
